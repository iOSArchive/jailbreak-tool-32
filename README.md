Jailbreak Tools for Old iOS Versions

Some tools might only support a version in a version series. Example: myjb only support iOS 10.1.1.

Some tools might only support a version arch in a version series. Example: myjb2 only support iOS 10 64bit.
                                                                           myjb25 only support iOS 10 32bit.
                                                                           
I'll not explaining what iOS version and arch that a tools is supported in details because this is a archive repository. You have to ask someone and get your iPA :)

Feels free to adding more tools and even write explaining for me :)
